# Inventory Management System GUI (JavaFX)
## Introduction

```text
Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create applications
with various features and functionality based on business requirements. When a new system is
developed, typically the process begins with a business analyst gathering and writing these business
requirements, with the assistance of subject matter experts from the business. Then a system analyst
works with several application team members and others to formulate a solution based on the
requirements. As a developer, you would then create a design document from the solution and finally
develop the system based on your design document.

For this assessment, you will create a Java application using the solution statements provided in the
requirements section.
